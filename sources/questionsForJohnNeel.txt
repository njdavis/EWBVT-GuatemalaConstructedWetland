# Questions for John Neel

## Wetland Questions

Is a Constructed Wetland a viable option, in his opinion?

CEFONMA's land has a high water table, or at least very saturated soil, what should we do with effluent once it leaves the system?

We are currently basing our calculations on EPA wastewater values, however Professor Thompson said that actual values leaving the tank would be a lot lower. Where can we water quality data for effluent leaving the septic tank?

If Gay and Neel implements constructed wetlands often, do they have any data on reliability? 

Are we using the right design models for our system? Does Gay and Neel use different equations?

What is hydrolic Loading Rate? How do we calculate it? 

What kind of factor of safety does Gay and Neel use for its system? What does he think we should use?

Does Gay and Neel have material cost data for the systems it has built in the past? How do we estimate how much material we need for a system based on knowing the size of the system?

-Will want an effluent filter in the tank (effluent T)

## Mound System Questions

John mentioned during our phone call that he thought Gay and Neel had implemented a gravity fed mound system a while ago. Would we be able to see those designs?
